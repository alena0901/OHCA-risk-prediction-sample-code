# OHCA-risk-prediction-sample-code
This repository contains the core analysis code and sample data for predicting out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) using machine learning methods. It provides example workflows for data processing, feature engineering, and model development.

## Overview

The provided code demonstrates the following workflow:
- Data preprocessing and transformation
- Feature selection and encoding
- Model development and hyperparameter tuning
- Performance evaluation using metrics such as AUC, sensitivity, specificity
- Visualization of ROC curves, learning curves, and feature importance

> **Note:** This repository only contains **sample data** for reproducibility and demonstration purposes. The original patient-level data are not included due to privacy and ethical restrictions.
